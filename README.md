Hi folks. Some ground rules:

1) Don't work in Master.
2) Don't Commit to Master
3) After you clone the repo, change to develop for working.
	– You can do this by running 'git checkout develop' from inside the repo
4) Don't forget to add a useful commit message
5) Don't forget that commiting doesn't push any changes
6) Don't forget to stage your changes before committing so you actually commit something
	– 'git status' will tell you what's staged and what isn't.
	– 'git branch' will tell you what branch you're working on.
7) Github is not a file dumping ground! Remember to pull before you start working so you don't overwrite someone else's changes!
