Hi folks. Some ground rules:

1. Don't work in Master.

2. Don't Commit to Master

3. After you clone the repo, change to develop for working.
	
	– You can do this by running 'git checkout develop' from inside the repo

4. Don't forget to add a useful commit message

5. Don't forget that commiting doesn't push any changes

6. Don't forget to stage your changes before committing so you actually commit something
	
	– 'git status' will tell you what's staged and what isn't.
	
	– 'git branch' will tell you what branch you're working on.

To run the demo, start a local HTTP server (for example `npx http-server`) and browse to http://localhost:8080.
